Building a desktop application on top of the NetBeans Platform can save years of development time.

The NetBeans Platform is a generic framework for Swing applications.
It provides the &quot;plumbing&quot; that, before, every developer
	                 had to write themselves&mdash;saving state, connecting
			             actions to menu items, toolbar items and keyboard shortcuts;  window
				                 management, and so on.
